### Payment

The payment module is deprecated will update it in later iterations

**Problem:** A user can go to `https://localhost:3000/checkout/checkout-success` and issue an order. It will clear the cart and show invoice i.e. placing an order without payment.
**workaround:** Need to resolve valid orders manually from dashboard. For real applications, we need to implement webhooks
